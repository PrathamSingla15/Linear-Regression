## Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
Linear regression aims to find the best-fit line that describes the relationship between the dependent variable Y and one or more independent variables X. The equation for a simple linear regression with one independent variable is given by:
Y= β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>X

where:
β<sub>0</sub> is the intercept
β<sub>1</sub>X is slope 

## Implementation steps:
<ol>
  <li>Gather data with both dependent and independent variable</li>
  <li>Handle missing data, outliers, and scale/normalize if needed</li>
  <li>Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
  <li>Use the training set to fit the linear regression model.</li>
  <li>Assess the model's performance using the testing set.</li>
  <li>Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.</li>
</ol>
